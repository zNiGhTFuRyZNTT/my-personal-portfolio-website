                    reelancing, Despite I was learning new skills everyday
                    but I realised that I need to put that skill to work and 
                    get my hands dirty, but unfortunately I was getting banned 
                    from freelancing websites such as Upwork etc. for being an Iranian! 
                    This was happening due to the American sanctions against my country Iran 
                    although I was living in Australia! So I decided to master my skills as much 
                    as I can in order to be able to find the best job possible to advance in my career.
                    I think it would be better that politicians keep their issues to themselves and 
                    not let them affect the young generation or the people of the world.
